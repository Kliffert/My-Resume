    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I am a 36-year-old web developer actively seeking employment. Despite managing the challenges of sarcoidosis,<br>
        I am a sociable individual with strong collaborative skills. My work history includes diverse experiences in construction,<br> 
        painting, and internships in childcare and healthcare settings. These roles have equipped me with valuable practical skills.<br> 
        Although my background is varied, I am eager to contribute to web development projects<br> 
        and continue expanding my expertise in the field.
